### Documentation for School Hierarchy Maker

#### Introduction
The **School Hierarchy Maker** is a simple Java application designed to model and manage the hierarchical structure of a school. The application utilizes a tree data structure to represent the relationships between various members of the school, including the principal, teachers, and students. The goal of this application is to provide a clear and easy-to-use interface to visualize the organizational structure of a school.

#### Features
1. **Add Principal**: The application starts with the ability to add a principal. The principal is the root of the hierarchy.
2. **Add Teacher**: After adding the principal, users can add teachers under the principalâ€™s supervision.
3. **Add Student**: Teachers can have students added beneath them in the hierarchy, creating a tree structure where students are related to specific teachers.
4. **Display Hierarchy**: Users can view the full school hierarchy, starting from the principal and expanding down to the teachers and their students.
5. **Search Member**: The search function allows users to find any member of the school (whether a principal, teacher, or student) and view their details along with their subordinates (children).
6. **Exit**: Users can exit the program at any time.

#### Motivation and Contribution
The **School Hierarchy Maker** was created to strengthen my understanding of tree data structures and recursion, which are key concepts in computer science. By modeling a real-world system (a school), I was able to apply theoretical concepts to a practical scenario.

- **Personal Contribution**: This application helped me enhance my Java programming skills, particularly in object-oriented programming, recursion, and tree traversal. It also gave me experience in designing a small but useful application from scratch.
  
- **Community Contribution**: For educational institutions, especially smaller ones, this application can help visualize and organize their administrative hierarchy, making it easier for staff to manage and understand the structure. Additionally, it serves as a good learning tool for anyone interested in learning about tree structures and Java programming.

In summary, this project is both a personal achievement and a potential tool for educational organizations, as it helps manage the structure of members and provides a foundational example of how hierarchical data can be managed using trees.
